###[A] Question as answer
This post isn't an actual attempt at answering the question. Please note [$SITENAME$ doesn't work like a discussion forum](//$SITEURL$/about), it is a Q&A site where every post is either a question or an answer to a question. Posts can also have [comments](//$SITEURL$/help/privileges/comment) - small sentences like this one - that can be used to critique or request clarification from an author. This should be either a comment or a [new question](//$SITEURL$/questions/ask).

###[A] Me too!
Please don't add *"Me too"* as an answer. It doesn't actually provide an answer to the question. If you have a different but related question, then [ask](//$SITEURL$/questions/ask) it (reference this one if it will help provide context). If you're interested in this specific question, you can show your interest by [upvoting](//$SITEURL$/help/privileges/vote-up) it or leaving a [comment](//$SITEURL$/help/privileges/comment) once you have enough [reputation](//$SITEURL$/help/whats-reputation).

###[A] Thanks!
Please don't add _"thanks"_ as answers. They don't actually provide an answer to the question, and can be perceived as noise by its future visitors. Once you [earn](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/146472) enough [reputation](//$SITEURL$/help/whats-reputation), you will gain privileges to [upvote answers](//$SITEURL$/help/privileges/vote-up) you like. This way future visitors of the question will see a higher vote count on that answer, and the answerer will also be rewarded with reputation points. See [Why is voting important](//$SITEURL$/help/why-vote).

###[A] Comment as answer
This does not provide an answer to the question. To critique or request clarification from an author, leave a comment below their post. If you earn sufficient [reputation](//$SITEURL$/help/whats-reputation) you will be able to [comment on any post](//$SITEURL$/help/privileges/comment).

###[A] Formatting issues
Take a moment to read through the [editing help](//$SITEURL$/editing-help) in the help center. Formatting on $SITENAME$ is different than other sites.

###[A] Duplicate link only
Please don't post link only answers to other $SITENAME$ questions. Instead, vote/flag to close as duplicate, or, if the question is not a duplicate, *tailor the answer to this specific question.*

###[A] Link only to other SE
Please don't post link only answers to other Stack Exchange questions. Instead, include the essential portions of the answer here, and *tailor the answer to this specific question.*

###[A] Link only answer
A link to a potential solution is always welcome, but please add context around the link so your fellow users will have some idea what it is and why it’s there. Always quote the most relevant part of an important link, in case the target site is unreachable or goes permanently offline. Take into account that being _barely more than a link to an external site_ is a possible reason as to [Why and how are some answers deleted?](//$SITEURL$/help/deleted-answers).

###[A] Answering off-topic / bad question
Please don't post answers on obviously off topic / bad questions!

###[A] Identical answers
Please don't post identical answers to multiple questions. Post one good answer, then vote/flag to close the other questions as duplicates. If the question is not a duplicate, *tailor your answers to the question.*

###[A] OP using an answer for further information
Please use the *Post answer* button only for actual answers. You should [edit] your original question to add additional information.

###[A] OP adding a new question as an answer
If you have another question, please ask it by clicking the [Ask Question](//$SITEURL$/questions/ask) button.

###[A] Non English answer
Please write your answer in English, since [$SITENAME$ is an English site.](//meta.stackexchange.com/q/13676)

###[A] Self Promotion
Just linking to your own library or tutorial is not a good answer. Linking to it, explaining why it solves the problem, providing information on how to do so and disclaiming that you wrote it makes for a better answer. See: [**What signifies “Good” self promotion?**](//meta.stackexchange.com/q/182212/200235)

###[A] Language, please
I know you're excited, but please try to keep your language under control. Think of $SITENAME$ as more like Wikipedia than like Reddit.

###[A] Borderline Link-Only answer
This is a borderline [link-only answer](//meta.stackexchange.com/q/8231/213671). You should expand your answer to include as much information here, and use the link only for reference.

###[A] Borderline-spam link answer
Please be careful with linking to your own content on different sites, you don't want to be a [spammer](//$SITEURL$/help/promotion). You should be including the majority of the content here, and use the link only as a reference.

###[A] Spam
Excessive promotion of a specific product/resource may be perceived by the community as **spam**. Take a look at the [help], specially [What kind of behavior is expected of users?](//$SITEURL$/help/behavior)'s last section: _Avoid overt self-promotion_. You might also be interested in [How do I advertise on $SITENAME$?](//$SITEURL$/help/advertising).

Please [edit] your post to include any additional information you have to your question. Avoid adding this in the comments, as they are harder to read and can be deleted easier. The edit button for your post is just below the post's tags.

###[Q] Too many ways to solve the problem
There are too many ways to approach this problem. The answers would just turn into a straw-poll for which one people liked. The best thing is to do some research on the topic yourself, find two or three, _analyze_ them, determine if they work for you or not. Come to us when you have a specific question about something you have attempted to understand.

###[Q] More than one question asked
It is preferred if you can post separate questions instead of combining your questions into one. That way, it helps the people answering your question and also others hunting for at least one of your questions.

###[Q] Non English question
Please write your question in English, since [$SITENAME$ is an English site.](//meta.stackexchange.com/q/13676)

###[Q] Software Rec. question
Unfortunately, questions asking us to recommend or find a tool, software library, tutorial or other off-site resource are off-topic here. However, you may find better luck [SoftwareRecs.SE](//softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/tour). Remember to read [their question requirements](//softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) as they are more strict than this site.

###[Q] SuperUser question
It seems you have a problem with using a specific piece of software. Generally these questions are off-topic for this site, but you might find better luck at [superuser](//superuser.com/tour). Remember to read [their requirements](//superuser.com/help/on-topic) as they are a bit more strict than this site.

###[Q] ServerFault question
It seems you have a problem with the configuration of server software. Generally these questions are off-topic for this site, but you might find better luck at [serverfault](//serverfault.com/tour). Remember to read [their requirements](//serverfault.com/help/on-topic) as they are a bit more strict than this site.

###[Q] PHP: What errors?
What does it mean "not working"? Do you get any errors? Add [error reporting](http://php.net/manual/en/function.error-reporting.php) at the top of your file(s): `ini_set("display_errors", 1); error_reporting(E_ALL);` and tell us what you get.

See the [**red box**](http://php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-connect.php)?

###[Q] Meta: Burnination request
Thank you for posting this burnination request and allowing the community to take a close look at it. Please note that burninations are not just tag removals - They are the process of carefully moderating a specific place of Stack Exchange. Avoid mass-editing the tag out of questions as it is counter-productive. For more information, see [Shog9's answer on MSE](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/239191/306392) or the [unofficial SOCVR process](https://github.com/SO-Close-Vote-Reviewers/SOCVR-RoomInformation/blob/master/burnination.md#process).
